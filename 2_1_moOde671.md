### moOde 6.7.1 Modification
We are here because it was chosen to modify the file ````playerlib.php```` for the release 6.7.1: please return to [previous](https://github.com/FdeAlexa/PeppyMeter_and_moOde/blob/main/2_moOde.md) page if your current release is not 6.7.1.

To modify it:
```
sudo nano /var/www/inc/playerlib.php
```
Let us go to the line 1694 (Ctrl "-1694")
and modify the current content from:
```
"name \"ALSA default\"\n" . "device \"hw:" . $device . ",0\"\n",
```
to the new content:
```
"name \"ALSA default\"\n" . "device \"peppyalsa\"\n",
```
Then save the file (Ctrl "o" and Enter)
and exit (Ctrl "x")

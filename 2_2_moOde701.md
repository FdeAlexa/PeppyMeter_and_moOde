### moOde 7.0.1 Modification
We are here because it was chosen to modify the file ````playerlib.php```` for the release 7.0.1: please return to [previous](https://github.com/FdeAlexa/PeppyMeter_and_moOde/blob/main/2_moOde.md) page if your current release is not 7.0.1.

Now we have to create a new files ````/etc/asound.conf````. In the third row (slave.pcm) of this file we have to put the default output we have in the moOde system.
This value (that normally is "hw:0,0" or "hw:1,0") is contained in the `aplay -l` results.
E.g. if the results is
```
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: PianoDAC [PianoDAC], device 0: Piano DAC HiFi pcm512x-hifi-0 [Piano DAC HiFi pcm512x-hifi-0]
Subdevices: 0/1
Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
```
The slave.pcm must contain "hw:X,Y" where X is the card (in this case "0") and Y is the device (in this case "0"): that means that we have to to insert:
`slave.pcm "hw:0,0"`

So: to create the file:
```
sudo nano /etc/asound.conf
```
Copy and past the following content:

```
pcm.peppyalsa {
       type meter
       slave.pcm "hw:0,0"
       scopes.0 peppyalsa
}
pcm_scope.peppyalsa {
       type peppyalsa
       decay_ms 400
       meter "/var/tmp/peppyfifo"
       meter_max 100
       meter_show 0
       spectrum "/var/tmp/peppyfifosa"
       spectrum_max 100
       spectrum_size 30
}
pcm_scope_type.peppyalsa {
       lib /usr/local/lib/libpeppyalsa.so
}
```
Modifying the value of the third row if necessary.
Then save the file (Ctrl "o" and Enter)
and exit (Ctrl "x")

Now let us modify moOde:
```
sudo nano /var/www/inc/playerlib.php
```
Let us go to the line 1994 (Ctrl "-1994" and Enter)
and modify the current content from:
```
"name \"ALSA default\"\n" . "device \"hw:" . $device . ",0\"\n",
```
to the new content:
```
"name \"ALSA default\"\n" . "device \"peppyalsa\"\n",
```
Then save the file (Ctrl "o" and Enter)
and exit (Ctrl "x")

### moOde 7.2.0 Modification
We are here because it was chosen to make the modification for the release 7.2.0: please return to [previous](https://github.com/FdeAlexa/PeppyMeter_and_moOde/blob/main/2_moOde.md) page if your current release is not 7.2.0.

Thanks to the new ALSA routing framework that supports the ALSA loopback at 384K, it is no longer necessary to modify the MPD configuration but it is sufficient to modify the ALSA branch that generates the loopback flow. To do this, let's edit the ````_sndaloop.conf```` file as follows:
```
sudo nano /etc/alsa/conf.d/_sndaloop.conf
```
change the line:
```
         b { channels 2 pcm "hw:Loopback,0" }     # Loopback output
```
with:
```
         b { channels 2 pcm "pippopeppy" }        # Loopback via peppy output
```
and append the following part at the end:
```
pcm.pippopeppy {
        type meter
        slave.pcm "hw:Loopback,0"
        scopes.0 peppyalsa
}

pcm_scope.peppyalsa {
        type peppyalsa
        decay_ms 400
        meter "/var/tmp/peppyfifo"
        meter_max 100
        meter_show 0
}

pcm_scope_type.peppyalsa {
        lib /usr/local/lib/libpeppyalsa.so
}
```
Then save the file (Ctrl "o" and Enter)
and exit (Ctrl "x")

Now we have to enable the loopback stream as follows:
At the moOde UI:
go to
```
Configure / Audio / ALSA Options
```
set ALSA Loopback to 
```
ON
```
and click on 
```
SET
```
